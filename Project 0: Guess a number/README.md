### 1. Project description

Guess a randomly generated number for a minimum number of attempts.

### 2. Case solved

We need to write a program which guesses a randomly generated number for a minimum number of attempts

**Conditions:**

- Computer chooses a random number from 0 to 100, and either a human or computer has to guess this number.
- The guessing algorithm evaluates whether each guessed number is larger, smaller or equal to the random number chosen by the computer

**Quality metric:**

- The results are evaluated based on the average number of attempts required to guess the random number right during 1000 iterations

**Learning curve:**

- How to write a clean and well-documented code
